Postgres Guide is maintained on a best effort basis. If you find it helpful I appreciate you sharing it with others. If you've got ways you think it could be better let me know [on twitter](http://www.twitter.com/craigkerstiens) or perhaps check out my [personal blog](http://www.craigkerstiens.com) for more content.

A special thanks to those who have already contributed content, and to [Matt Graham](http://www.twitter.com/michigangraham) for the wonderful design.
